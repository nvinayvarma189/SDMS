Java Project : Students Dairy

This project was first built with many classes and later on reduced and made the classes
only if they are needed and the common functions are completely utilized using the oops concepts.

This project is mainly build through HashMap and few text files. Initially the project
has three students. We can perform any operations on them including viewing thier academic and
personal activities and performance.These details can be inputed by the councellor
and faculty and can be viewed by the students and parents.

The main block used in this project is HashMap, because pairing the details of the
student with his roll number is quite easy.

**The extra feautures added in this project which are not available in the Universty's Management System (AUMS) :**

1. The councellor can add any number of students and can input the details so that
the added students can view their details.

2. The Councellor can input the behaviour of the student in class hours and this
behaviour can be viewed by the faculty, Councellor, parents and not by the student.

3. Instead of being in dilema whether if a student's duty leaves are approve dor not.
The student can view the number of duty leaves that are approved, which can be
inputted by the councellor.The duty leave details can also be viewed by the faculty and they
can update the students attendance.
